this is the source code for 'untitled' ([acgaudette.itch.io/jam24](https://acgaudette.itch.io/jam24)).
it is written in lobster ([strlen.com/lobster](https://strlen.com/lobster)),
although it embeds my modified version of the runtime
([github.com/acgaudette/lobster](https://github.com/acgaudette/lobster)) which you may need in order to run it.

the shell was adapted from
[github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/main/src/shell_minimal.html](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/main/src/shell_minimal.html)

since this was my first time using lobster, the code is *not* idiomatic;
there are bits of code everywhere that I assume could easily be simplified
after taking another look at the API docs / source,
I just didn't have the time to do so on this project.
